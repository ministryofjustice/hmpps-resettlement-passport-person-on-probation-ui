            <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Plan your future service, available at <a href="https://plan-your-future.service.gov.uk" target="_blank">plan-your-future.service.gov.uk</a>.</p>
            <p>This website is run by HMPPS. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
                <li>zoom in up to 200% without problems</li>
                <li>navigate the website using just a keyboard</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We have also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/" target="_blank">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device (laptop, phone) easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

                How accessible this website is
            </h2>

            <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible, for example:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>there is no timeout warning when the user’s session is about to expire</li>
                <li>there is only one way to navigate the site, for example there is no sitemap</li>
                <li>some pages have layouts that do not display correctly when magnified or resized</li>
                <li>some images are missing alt text that correctly describe what the image is conveying</li>
                <li>some pages contain an illogical focus order which makes it difficult for a user to navigate with a keyboard.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l govuk-!-padding-top-8">
